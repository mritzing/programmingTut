## Python Syntax


Python was designed to be a highly readable language.  In python logic statements are separated by newlines, unlike other programming languages that may use semicolons.


#### Indentation
Python's indentation is important to how the code functions.  It is used to indicate blocks of code (whether that be inside a loop/function/class/etc).  
For example the tabbed lines in the code below indicate everything that is contained within the if statement.
```python
if x < 10: 
	x = x + 1
    print(x)
```
Tabs can be either 4 spaces or a tab, inside your code you cannot use both it will produce an error.  Most text editors / IDE can be set up to automatically convert tabs to spaces or vise-versa.

#### Comments
Comments in python are denoted by the # character and will be ignored when the code is run.  Multi-line comments or docstrings are also possible using triple quotes to contain them.

```python
#This is a comment
""" This is
a docstring """
print ("Only this line will run")
```
