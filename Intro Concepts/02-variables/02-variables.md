## Variables


Variables are used to store values in code
* The value stored can be accessed or changed later in code
* The type of the variable is determined by Python (unlike other languages where it must be explicitly stated)
* The values of variables are assigned with an equal sign with the name of the variable on the left and the value on the right 
#### Types of Variables
Some examples of variables are:

* Boolean : True or False 
* String : A series of characters surrounded by single or double quotes : "A String"
* Integer : A whole number  
* Float : Floating point number, a number with a fractional value
```python
	# True/False is case senstitive in python and are reserved words 
    testBool = True
    # This is a string
    message = "Hello World"
    # This will print the value of the message variable Hello World
    print(message)
    #Variables can be redefined
    message = "Goodbye World" 
    print(message)
    
    x = 1
    y = 4
    sum = x + y
    print (x)
    print (sum)
```

#### Naming rules
* Must begin with a letter or an underscore (a-z, A-Z or _)
* Cannot start with a number
* Case sensitive
* There are some reserved words that cannot be used as Python uses them elsewhere , ex : (True, False)
#### Good Naming Conventions
* Try to use meaningful names (of reasonable length) in your code, item_grid is more descriptive than ig
* Be consistent in how you write your variables, itemGrid or item_grid
* Variables beginning with an underscore are often used for internal variables in code (this will be covered later, but avoid naming variables starting with _ for now)


#### Vocab: 
* Boolean : True or False 
* String : A series of characters surrounded by single or double quotes : "A String"
* Integer : A whole number  
* Float : Floating point number, a number with a fractional value
